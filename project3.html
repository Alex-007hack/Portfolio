        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">Covid-19 has brought about drastic changes to everything around us. Information technology is definitely the key player which enabled all these changes. Everything from buying household things to booking tickets and holding meetings have become digitalized. All these have brought down the need for physical interactions between the people. However, the primary barrier we have, against the pandemic is indeed vaccination.

            These days most institutions, be it private or government owned, demand a vaccination certificate, for physical dealings. It is often difficult to keep the hard copy certificate in handy.  We propose to develop a mobile application, which can be used by the people to feed in, their vaccination details. At the same time, a different interface of the app will be available to the clients (film theatres, hospitals, shopping malls etc..) to check the vaccination status of their customers, just by scanning a unique QR code which is given to the person, While feeding the vaccination details into the app. In addition to the vaccination details, the health status of the person in the past 24 hours can also be entered. This means that scanning a QR code (available even offline in the app) will provide both the vaccination details and the health status of the customer.
